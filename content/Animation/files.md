The following files are used as a starting template to create animations for Project Zomboid. They contain the armature along with a character mesh which you can use to start animating.

The .fbx file was grabbed from the Project Zomboid official discord and is a generic file you should be able to use in the modeling software of your choice.

The .blend file is a slight tweak of the .fbx file to give an instant start template if you're working with Blender. It's compatible with Blender 2.83+.
